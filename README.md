# web application for the management of traffic offenses (IRPP)

The objective targeted in this personal project is the design and development of 
a web application for the management of traffic offenses, with the aim of ensuring 
road safety, especially since Algeria is ranked at the top of the list of countries 
in terms of number of deaths due to road accidents. The system to be developed 
consists of computerizing information on drivers and their driving license, type, place 
and date of infringements, as well as penalties according to the scale of points withdrawal. 
This application allows to manage and have quick access to all information concerning 
drivers and traffic offenses committed.
